**Exploring the 2025 Electric Vehicle Market**

**Project Overview**

  With the rapid expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) market, consumers face an overwhelming number of options. This project addresses the challenge of "choice paralysis" by analyzing the specifications of over 470 EV models planned for 2025. The goal is to create a practical guide that helps potential buyers narrow down their choices to a manageable and relevant list based on their specific lifestyle and priorities.
  By defining distinct consumer personas, this analysis moves beyond simple technical comparisons to provide tailored recommendations, ensuring buyers can find a vehicle that truly fits their needs without overspending on unnecessary features.

**Raw Dataset**

The analysis is based on the "Electric Vehicle Specifications Dataset 2025," which contains detailed information on battery capacity, range, charging speed, physical dimensions, and performance metrics for each vehicle.

**Insights & Findings**

The analysis of the 2025 EV market reveals several key trends:
- Diverse Range of Models: The market has matured significantly, now offering everything from compact city cars to luxury SUVs and high-performance sports sedans.
- Increasing Battery Capacity & Range: A clear trend is the growth in battery capacity across all segments. Compact cars now regularly exceed 300 km of range, while larger SUVs can achieve over 550 km.
- Improved Performance: Manufacturers are successfully closing the performance gap with internal combustion engines, with many EVs now offering impressive acceleration and top speeds.
- Expansion into New Segments: The market is expanding beyond early-adopter segments into luxury SUVs, passenger vans, and high-performance vehicles, catering to a broader consumer base.
- Focus on Efficiency: Alongside range, manufacturers are increasingly focused on energy efficiency (Wh/km), which translates to lower running costs for consumers.

The overall verdict is that there is no single "best" electric car, only the best electric car for an individual's specific needs.

**AI Support Explanation**

This project was developed in collaboration with a generative AI (IBM Granite), which served as a key partner throughout the analytical process. The AI's contribution was instrumental in several key areas:
- Initial Data Interpretation: The AI provided a rapid and comprehensive overview of the dataset, outlining its structure and potential applications.
- Ideation and Problem Framing: The AI acted as a brainstorming partner, helping to transform the broad idea of "too many EV choices" into a concrete, data-driven project by proposing the "Perfect EV Profile" framework.
- Persona Development and Analysis: The AI executed the core analysis by defining distinct consumer personas and applying data-driven filters to generate tailored vehicle recommendations for each group.
- Content and Narrative Generation: The AI assisted in articulating the project's findings, drafting the final verdict, and creating structured content for the presentation slides.

The use of AI accelerated the project timeline and enriched the analysis by providing immediate, structured, and relevant data processing and content generation.
